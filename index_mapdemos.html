    <h1>Toponym Identification on Scanned Old Maps</h1>
    <p>
      This page showcases some experimental work on the automatic identification of 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toponym">toponyms</a> on scanned old maps, using
      Open Source software. While fully automatic detection and transcription of place names
      is unrealistic based on today's technology, our goal is eliminate as much as possible of
      the heavy lifting and manual preparatory work required to annotate scanned maps.

    <p>
      This work is in an early stage &amp; yet unfunded, so bear with us regarding the 
      bare-bone state of this site!

    <h2>Automatic Toponym Detection</h2>
    <p>
      The first challenge is to identify <strong>where</strong> on the map place names are located. We
      have experimented with image processing techniques (using the Open Source
      <a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com">OpenCV</a> toolkit) and different types of maps. Examples
      are below.
    </p>

    <h2>Automatic Toponym Transcription</h2>
    <p>
      Once we have identified candidates that may be place names, we need to transcribe them. Automating the
      transcription is the most challenging step in the process; and it is highly dependent on the type of map
      whether there is even a chance to achieve this with present-day technology. We are currently experimenting
      with <a href="http://gamera.informatik.hsnr.de/">Gamera</a> to get a feel for what can be achieved with
      state of the art tools.

    <h2>Manual Annotation</h2>
    <p>
      While machines fail miserably in map transcription tasks, humans can read and transcribe 
      place name labels with relative (depending on the type of map) ease. It is simply the magnitude
      of the task that makes it challenging to deal with: map collections often host 1.000s of maps,
      each potentially containing 100s of place names.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our goal is to build tools that allow human users to perform selection, transcription, and annotation tasks
      as quickly as possible.
