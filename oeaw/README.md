## Setup

- run `npm install` to fetch dependencies

## Build

Run `npm run bundle` to build the distributable .js file. The file will be in the `dist` folder.

To enable a minified build, add the following to `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript
plugins: [
  new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
    include: /\.min\.js$/,
    minimize: true
  })
]
```
