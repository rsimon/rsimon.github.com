        "location_description": "Around the middle of the 19th century the Viennese Serbs set about founding their church parish of Saint Sava under the leadership of Privy Councillor Dr. Georgije Stojaković. The Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Rajačić, the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1.000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.\nUntil the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 Florin (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the \"Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors\" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 Florin (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 in the third district (1030) of Vienna for 27,000 Florin (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 Florin (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 Florin (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers. \nAfter the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality. \nOn 19 November 1893, the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War.\n",

On the first Auction (10-16 October 1905) Queen Natalija sold objects of the Kings Milan and Aleksandar. It was a total of 1166 objects (silverware, porcelain, ivory, bronze, vases, statues, lamps, paintings and furniture from the Belgrade Palace). The second auction took place on 30 October 1906.

During his rule, after two Serbian-Ottoman Wars (1876-1878), Serbia became an independent state, internationally recognized by the Treaty of Berlin (1878). It was also a period of modernization. He abdicated in 1889, and his 13 year old son Aleksandar became King. After the abdication King Milan lived in Paris and in 1897 returned to Serbia, where he was installed as the commander-in-chief of the Serbian army. After a disagreement on his son´s wedding with Draga Mašin he left Serbia. He settled in Vienna, where he died on 11 February 1901.\nHe was a close friend of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, who awarded Milan on 7 January 1870 with the Grand Cordon of The Austrian Imperial Order of Leopold (Großkreuz des Leopoldordens). Also the 97th Infanterie Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army was named after him in 1883 (until 1892) (Küstenländisch-krainerisches Infanterieregiment Nr. 97). There are several compositions of Austrian composers, which were dedicated to King Milan: Philipp Fahrbach Junior dedicated two compositions to King Milan and Queen Natalija (1884), Anton Riedl the “King Milan March” (1885), and three songs by Carl Streitmann (1887).  \nFrom autumn 1900 he lived in Vienna, firstly in the Hotel Imperial and then in an apartment in Johannesgasse 16.

On the first Auction (10-16 October 1905) Queen Natalija sold objects of the Kings Milan and Aleksandar. It was a total of 1166 objects (silverware, porcelain, ivory, bronze, vases, statues, lamps, paintings and furniture from the Belgrade Palace). The second auction took place on 30 October 1906.

He was founder and professor of the High School, the forerunner of the Belgrade University. Obradović was born in the Romanian part of Banat of the then Habsburg Empire. He became monk and received the monk name Dositej, but then he abandoned the call and went on trips all over Europe, where he learned about the ideas of European Enlightenment and rationalism. Guided by such ideas he worked on enlightening his people, translated various works among which the most famous are Ezop's fables.\nObradović was born in Čakovo (today Romania) near Temesvar. From 1757 until 1760 he was at the monastery Hopovo, where he became a monk with the name Dositej. From 1760 until 1771 he travelled through the Balkan Peninsula, Asia Minor and many other regions and towns including Constantinople. In 1771 he arrived in Vienna. In his autobiography he describes his life in Vienna from 1771 until 1777 where he was in very friendly relations with Serbs and Greeks. Obradović taught there Greek and during the first few months he had about 12 students. In the same time Dositej paid for lectures in French and Latin, and in his third year in Vienna he gave lectures to the others in these two languages. He met all the relevant Serbs in Vienna, who had huge influence on his social life, namely Atanasije Demetrović Sekereš, Baron and General Mihailo Mikašinović and his family, Baron and General Arsenije Sečujac and many others. In house of Baron Mikašinović he gave lessons in French to the daughter of the General Sava Prodanović called Marta. Apart from social life, Dositej describes Vienna at that time and his visits to Belvedere, Prater, Augarten and Schönbrunn. He visited the Opera, theatres and libraries. Obradović left Vienna in 1777 and after travelling huge parts of Europe he came to Halle in Germany in 1782. Here he took off the monk´s clothes and started to study at the University of Halle. He visited lectures onphilosophy, aesthetic and theology. In this period he began to write and in 1783 he published his first work „Писмо Харалампију“ („A letter to Haralampije“) in Leipzig. From Germany he travelled to France and from there to London where he stayed for six months and learned English. From 1785 until 1788 he lived again in Vienna and worked as a teacher. In his autobiography he described his relations with one of the richest Serbian merchants in Vienna at that time, Maksim Kurtović and his wife Jelena. They were very good friends, and Dositej taught their two daughters Marija and Hristina in French and Italian. From 1789 to 1802 Dositej settled in Vienna. In the same year Field marshal Laudon drove the Ottomans out of Belgrade, and Dositej greeted this event as the beginning of the liberty of the Serbian nation in his poem “Песна о избавленију Србије“ (“Poem of salvation of Serbia”). He printed this Poem in Vienna like the “Собраније“ from 1793. Dositej stayed in Vienna for the next twelve years, writing and printing both original works and translations. After the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1804, Dositej returned to Serbia in 1806, where he founded the High School (forerunner of the Belgrade University) and was the first Minister of Education in the first Serbian government. He died on 28 March 1811 in Belgrade, where he was buried. \n",

After taking part in the Austro-Turkish war, Sava's grandfather, Jovan Popović-Tekelija, was appointed by Prince Eugene of Savoy as the captain of the Serbian police (300 pistols and 200 horsemen) in 1698 and was ordered to build the Arad fortress. In 1705 the construction of the church of St. Peter and Paul, the so-called Tekelija´s church, was finished. The family Tekelija was the patron of this church until 1844, when the last male descendant died. Here was buried Sava Tekelija in 1842. In 1706 Jovan Popović-Tekelija was ennobled and received the coat of arms.\nIn the years 1779/80 Tekelija wrote that his cousin from Russia came, gave him 100 rubles and took him to Vienna. For that money he bought a new suit and a golden watch. The first stay of Sava Tekelija in Vienna was from 1780 until 1782. It is alleged that he went there by his parent´s will, but he failed to enroll in the military academy. In Vienna he acquired rich knowledge: he visited lectures at the University (criminal, canonical, natural and general law, physics, anatomy, chemistry, botany), learned drawing, flute playing, French, Italian and Spanish. From 1782 to 1786 he studied law in Buda, where he earned the title of Doctor of Law, and became the first Serb doctor of law. \nIn 1804 he wrote to Napoleon, proposing that he should establish the Kingdom of Illyria, which would include: Serbia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Boka Kotorska and Dubrovnik. In 1805 he addressed the Austrian Emperor Franz I with a proposal on cooperation between Austria and Russia against Germany and France.\nThe Illyrian Court Office (Cancelaria Illyrica aulica) was founded on 22 February 1791 and was already abolished on 3 July 1792 after the agreement of Emperor Franz with the Hungarian nobility. The successor of this office was the Hungarian Court Office.\nDuring his second stay in Vienna from 1792 to 1798, Tekelija was secretary at the Hungarian Court Office. Although he fought for Serbian rights, he did not succeed in this task, and after the retirement of Bishop Petrović, Tekelija aimed at on his position. However, since he was neither supported by Serbs nor Germans nor Hungarians in the office, he submitted his resignation in October 1798. On this occasion he wrote in his diary about his audience to Emperor Franz I.\nSince then, Tekelija was staying in Vienna for at least three occasions: In 1804, when he wrote the letter to Napoleon through the French deputy, in 1805, when he printed his map of Serbia and other countries in 2,000 copies, and in 1838, when he was on his way to Bavaria for medical treatment,came to Vienna to take a passport and stayed there for a week. Then he recorded that he saw: \"steam cars on the railroad tracks, from Prater to Wagram.\" After returning from the spa, he again resided in Vienna in order to obtain permission to establish his foundation, since then known as “Tekelijanum”. In the “Tekelijanum” in Pest from 1838 until 1914 more than 350 Serbian students, among them the famous scientist Nikola Tesla,were accepted and received scholarships.\nIn addition to other plans, Tekelija stated that two children of Serbian officers should be sent to the Engineering Academy in Vienna and, later, that more than 20 Serbian children in Vienna should be educated. For the same reason, he again resided in Vienna in June 1840. In addition to the “Tekelijanum” and the fund for his scholarship, Tekelija also left 100,000 forint for the Serbian students of the Engineering Academy in Vienna, where for four students, which were to be named by the Metropolitan of Karlovci were to receive 4,000 forint.

    "description": "Djordje Stratimirović Ritter von Kulpin (1822-1908), was a prominent Serbian army commander in Vojvodina and a General Major in the Austrian army who was born in Novi Sad. His ancestor Bogić Vučković von Stratimirović, originally from Herzegovina, fought on the side of Austria in the Austro-Turkish War of 1737-39. As a bargain for this, he received from Empress Maria Theresa in 1745 the feudal estate of Kulpin as well as the Hungarian nobility, together with his brothers Ivan, Toma and Nikola. Djordje Stratimirović attended the Viennese Engineering Academy from 1837 to 1841. He was the military leader of the Serbs in the Revolution of 1848-49 against the Hungarians. At the May Assembly of 1848, he was elected as the President of the Main Committee of the Serbian People and as Provisional Army Chief. In October Stratimirović left to Šupljikac the command of the army and took on the task to go to Emperor Franz Josef I in order to acknowledge the decisions of the May Assembly. \nIn 1849 Stratimirović re-entered the Austrian army in the rank of Colonel at the invitation of Prince Felix Schwarzenberg. \nStratimirović married Albine von Beck on 10 May 1854 in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity on Fleischmarkt. They were married by Bishop Platon Atanacković of Novi Sad, and the bestman was Prince Mihailo Obrenović. After the church ceremony a wedding celebration was held at the Hotel “Stadt London”. The godfathers of Stratimirović children were the Princes Michael and Milan Obrenović. \nIn 1859 Stratimirović left the military service in the rank of Major General. After his military career he was engaged in diplomacy and politics. First he had diplomatic missions in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Epirus and Corfu, and was General Governor of Dalmatia and General Consul of Sicily. In the Hungarian Parliament (1865-1872) he led the Serbian conservatives fighting against the political subjugation of the Serbs. In the autumn of 1877 Stratimirović settled in Vienna, where he would remain until the end of his life. \nHe wrote articles for many newspapers: „Politik“, „Wiener Tagblattes“, „Vorstadtzeitung“, „Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung“, „Vaterland“ and „Tribüne“. 1893 in the edition \"Separate aus den Wissenschaftlichen Mitteilungen aus Bosnien und der Herzegowina, Band I\" Stratimirović published his paper \"Ausgrabungen auf der Hochebene Glasinac im Jahre 1891. Vorläufiger Bericht. Mit 33 Abbildungen \". In 1896 King Alexander Obrenović honored him with the Order of the Takovo Cross.

        "entity_description": "Djordje Stratimirović Ritter von Kulpin (1822-1908), was a prominent Serbian army commander in Vojvodina and a General Major in the Austrian army who was born in Novi Sad. His ancestor Bogić Vučković von Stratimirović, originally from Herzegovina, fought on the side of Austria in the Austro-Turkish War of 1737-39. As a bargain for this, he received from Empress Maria Theresa in 1745 the feudal estate of Kulpin as well as the Hungarian nobility, together with his brothers Ivan, Toma and Nikola. Djordje Stratimirović attended the Viennese Engineering Academy from 1837 to 1841. He was the military leader of the Serbs in the Revolution of 1848-49 against the Hungarians. At the May Assembly of 1848, he was elected as the President of the Main Committee of the Serbian People and as Provisional Army Chief. In October Stratimirović left to Šupljikac the command of the army and took on the task to go to Emperor Franz Josef I in order to acknowledge the decisions of the May Assembly. \nIn 1849 Stratimirović re-entered the Austrian army in the rank of Colonel at the invitation of Prince Felix Schwarzenberg. \nStratimirović married Albine von Beck on 10 May 1854 in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity on Fleischmarkt. They were married by Bishop Platon Atanacković of Novi Sad, and the bestman was Prince Mihailo Obrenović. After the church ceremony a wedding celebration was held at the Hotel “Stadt London”. The godfathers of Stratimirović children were the Princes Michael and Milan Obrenović. \nIn 1859 Stratimirović left the military service in the rank of Major General. After his military career he was engaged in diplomacy and politics. First he had diplomatic missions in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Epirus and Corfu, and was General Governor of Dalmatia and General Consul of Sicily. In the Hungarian Parliament (1865-1872) he led the Serbian conservatives fighting against the political subjugation of the Serbs. In the autumn of 1877 Stratimirović settled in Vienna, where he would remain until the end of his life. \nHe wrote articles for many newspapers: „Politik“, „Wiener Tagblattes“, „Vorstadtzeitung“, „Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung“, „Vaterland“ and „Tribüne“. 1893 in the edition \"Separate aus den Wissenschaftlichen Mitteilungen aus Bosnien und der Herzegowina, Band I\" Stratimirović published his paper \"Ausgrabungen auf der Hochebene Glasinac im Jahre 1891. Vorläufiger Bericht. Mit 33 Abbildungen \". In 1896 King Alexander Obrenović honored him with the Order of the Takovo Cross. In 1907 he was knighted from the Emperor Franz Josef I (Ritter von).\nDjordje Stratimirović died on 15 December 1908 in his apartment in Klagbaumgasse 17 (1040) where he lived since 1894. Emperor Franz Josef I received news about Stratimirović death with special regret.

The medallion with a portrait of prince Miloš supported by her hand alludes to her ancestors. According to tradition, Prince Miloš was particularly closely related to Savka, who was his favourite child. At the age of seventeen she got married to Baron Jovan Nikolić of Rudna, with whom she had five sons.\"\nhttps://izi.travel/en/286d-miklos-barabas-savka-obrenovic/en",
