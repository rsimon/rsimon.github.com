      <h1>Toponym Identification on Scanned Old Maps</h1>
      <p>
        This page showcases some experimental work on the automatic identification of 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toponym">toponyms</a> on scanned old maps using
        Open Source software. Fully automatic detection and transcription of place names
        is, arguably, not achievable with today's technology. Therefore, our goal is to devise
        semi-automated methods which eliminate as much as possible of the tedious manual
        effort that is required to annotate map scans.

      <p>
        This work is in its earliest stages &amp; we have no offical project set up around this yet.
        So bear with us regarding the bare-bone state of this site! (Many thanks go out to our intern
        Peter, for taming OpenCV and devising increasingly clever image filtering methods!) 
      </p> 

      <h2>Automatic Toponym Detection</h2>
      <p>
        The first challenge is to identify <strong>where</strong> on the map place names are located. We
        are experimenting with image processing techniques (using the Open Source
        <a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com">OpenCV</a> toolkit) and different types of maps. Examples
        are below.

      <h2>Automatic Toponym Transcription</h2>

      </a>
      <p>
        Once we have identified candidates that may be place names, we need to transcribe them. Automating the
        transcription is the most challenging step in the process. We are currently experimenting
        with the document analysis framework <a href="http://gamera.informatik.hsnr.de/">Gamera</a> 
        to get a feel for what can be achieved with state of the art tools.
        Additionally, we aim to exploit the <strong>layout</strong> of identified candidates to deduce possible 
        place names based on existing toponym lists: e.g. in the case of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portolan_chart">portolan charts</a>, toponyms are arranged
        in sequence along the coastline. This sequential ordering may potentially allow for some degree
        of &quot;interpolation&quot; of unidentified names.
      </p>

      <h2>Manual Annotation</h2>
      <p>
        For most old maps, machines still fail miserably in map transcription tasks. Humans, on the other
        hand, can read and transcribe place name labels with relative (depending on the type of map) ease. However, 
        the sheer magnitude of the task makes it challenging to deal with: map collections often host 1.000s of maps,
        each potentially containing 100s of place names. Our goal is to build tools that allow human users to 
        <a href="http://github.com/rsimon/toponymotator">perform selection, transcription, and annotation tasks as 
        efficiently as possible</a>, or to quickly validate and correct automatically generated results.
      </p>

      <h2>Annotated Maps: Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
        Once a map's place names are annotated, there are plenty of benefits. Enhanced search & linking with a historic
        Gazetteer are likely the most important ones. But there are also more playful, casual use cases:
  
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Map re-labelling.</strong> Using toponym detection and a technique called
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpainting">inpainting</a>, we can replace the original labels
            for better readability, or to &quot;translate&quot; them to their modern-day counterparts.
