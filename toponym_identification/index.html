    <h1>Toponym Identification on Scanned Old Maps</h1>
    <p>
      This page showcases some experimental work on the automatic identification of 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toponym">toponyms</a> on scanned old maps using
      Open Source software. Fully automatic detection and transcription of place names
      is, arguably, not achievable with today's technology. Therefore, our goal is to devise
      semi-automated methods which eliminate as much as possible of the tedious manual
      effort that is required to annotate map scans.

    <p>
      This work is in an early stage &amp; we don't have an offical project set up for this yet.
      (Many thanks go out to our intern Peter, for taming OpenCV and devising increasingly clever
      image filtering methods!) So bear with us regarding the  bare-bone state of this site!
    </p> 

    <h2>Automatic Toponym Detection</h2>
    <p>
      The first challenge is to identify <strong>where</strong> on the map place names are located. We
      are experimenting with image processing techniques (using the Open Source
      <a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com">OpenCV</a> toolkit) and different types of maps. Examples
      are below.

    <h2>Automatic Toponym Transcription</h2>
    <p>
      Once we have identified candidates that may be place names, we need to transcribe them. Automating the
      transcription is the most challenging step in the process. We are currently experimenting
      with <a href="http://gamera.informatik.hsnr.de/">Gamera</a> to get a feel for what can be achieved with
      state of the art tools.
    </p>

    <h2>Manual Annotation</h2>
    <p>
      For most old maps, machines still fail miserably in map transcription tasks. Humans, on the other
      hand, can read and transcribe place name labels with relative (depending on the type of map) ease. However, 
      the sheer magnitude of the task makes it challenging to deal with: map collections often host 1.000s of maps,
      each potentially containing 100s of place names. Our goal is to build
      <a href="http://github.com/rsimon/toponymotator">tools that allow human users 
      to perform selection, transcription, and annotation tasks as quickly as possible</a>. 
    </p>

    <h2>Annotated Maps: Use Cases</h2>
    <p>
      Once a map's place names are annotated there are plenty of benefits. Enhanced search & linking with a historic
      Gazetteer are likely the most obvious ones. But there are also more playful, casual use cases:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Map re-labelling.</strong> Using toponym detection and 
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpainting">inpainting</a>, we can replace the original labels
          for better readability, or to &quot;translate&quot; them to their modern-day counterparts.
